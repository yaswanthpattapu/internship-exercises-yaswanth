1. Retrieve everything from a table : select * from cd.facilities;

2. Retrieve specific columns from a table : select name,membercost from cd.facilities;

3. Control which rows are retrieved : select * from cd.facilities where membercost!=0;

4. Control which rows are retrieved - part 2 : 
select facid,name,membercost,monthlymaintenance from cd.facilities where membercost>0 and membercost<0.02*monthlymaintenance;

5. Basic string searches : select * from cd.facilities where name like '%Tennis%';

6. Matching against multiple possible values : select * from cd.facilities where facid in (1,5);

7. Classify results into buckets : 
select name, 
case 
	when monthlymaintenance>100 then 'expensive'
	else 'cheap'
end as cost
from cd.facilities;

8. Working with dates : 
select memid, surname, firstname, joindate from cd.members
where joindate >= '2012-09-01'; 

9. Removing duplicates, and ordering results : 
select distinct surname from cd.members order by surname asc limit 10;

10. Combining results from multiple queries : 
select surname from cd.members union select name from cd.facilities;

11. Simple aggregation : select max(joindate) from cd.members;

12. More aggregation : select firstname,surname,joindate from cd.members where joindate=(select max(joindate) from cd.members);
