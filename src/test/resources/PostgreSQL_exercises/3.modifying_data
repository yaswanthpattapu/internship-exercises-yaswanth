1. Insert some data into a table :

insert into cd.facilities(facid,name,membercost,guestcost,initialoutlay,monthlymaintenance)
values(9,'Spa',20,30,100000,800);

2. Insert multiple rows of data into a table :

insert into cd.facilities(facid,name,membercost,guestcost,initialoutlay,monthlymaintenance)
values(9,'Spa',20,30,100000,800),(10,'Squash Court 2',3.5,17.5,5000,80);

3. Insert calculated data into a table :

insert into cd.facilities(facid,name,membercost,guestcost,initialoutlay,monthlymaintenance)
values((select max(facid) from cd.facilities) + 1,'Spa',20,30,100000,800);

4. Update some existing data :

update cd.facilities set initialoutlay = 10000 where facid = 1;

5. Update multiple rows and columns at the same time :

update cd.facilities set membercost = 6, guestcost = 30 where name in ('Tennis Court 1', 'Tennis Court 2');

6. Update a row based on the contents of another row :

update cd.facilities set membercost = 1.1*(select membercost from cd.facilities where facid = 0), guestcost = 1.1*(select guestcost from cd.facilities where facid = 0) where facid=1;

7. Delete all bookings :

delete from cd.bookings;

8. Delete a member from the cd.members table :

delete from cd.members where memid=37;

9. Delete based on a subquery :

delete from cd.members where memid not in (select memid from cd.bookings);
